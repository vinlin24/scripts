# scripts

This repository includes a collection of simple PowerShell scripts that
I've written to automate certain tasks. Most of these also come with
installation instructions for if you, a lucky passerby, want to make
your Windows workflow just a bit more convenient too!

Check them out here:

- [Format Spaces](desktop-shortcut)
- [Downloads Paster](downloads-paster)
- [Format Spaces](format-spaces)


I also linked this repository to my
[PowerShell profile script backup](https://github.com/vinlin24/PS-profile)
since I thought it seemed relevant. There you can see the kind of
convenience functions I've written to improve my own command line
workflow!
